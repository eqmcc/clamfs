ClamFS is a FUSE-based user-space file system for Linux with on-access
anti-virus file scanning through clamd daemon (a file scanning service
developed by ClamAV Project).

To build ClamFS on GNU/Linux you need:
 * FUSE
 * GNU libCommonCpp (and libxml2 as it's dependency)
 * RLog
 * POCO[1]

To build ClamFS on FreeBSD you need those ports:
 * sysutils/fusefs-libs
 * devel/rlog
 * devel/poco-ssl (or devel/poco)
 * devel/commoncpp

As a run-time dependency you need:
 * ClamAV (clamd) [FreeBSD port: security/clamav]
 * FUSE kernel module [FreeBSD port: sysutils/fusefs-kmod]

[1] - POCO version 1.2.8 contain 4-BSDL licensed files and thus you
      should avoid linking it against any GPL licensed code. I strongly
      advise using version 1.2.9 (as license issues has been fixed).
